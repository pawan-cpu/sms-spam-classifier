# Email Spam Classifier
This repository contains code for an end-to-end email spam classifier project. The project aims to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using various machine learning models and deploy the best-performing model for real-world use.

# Overview
Email spam continues to be a significant issue, with unwanted emails cluttering inboxes and potentially causing security risks. This project addresses this problem by developing a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or ham.

# Features
- Data preprocessing: Clean and tokenize email text, remove stop words, and convert text into numerical representations.
- Model training: Train multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Linear Regression, to classify emails.
- Model comparison: Evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Model deployment: Deploy the best-performing model as an API endpoint for real-time email classification.
  
#Usage
To use this project:

# Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-classifier.git

# Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter notebook email_spam_classifier.ipynb to preprocess the data, train different models, and evaluate their performance.
Once you have identified the best-performing model, deploy it using the provided deployment scripts.
Model Comparison
In this project, we compare the performance of the following machine learning models:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Linear Regression
We evaluate these models based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which one is best suited for classifying email spam.
